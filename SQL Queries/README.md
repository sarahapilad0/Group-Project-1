This folder contains SQL queries used for interacting with the hospital database in this project. The queries are applicable for both MySQL and MS Access databases. The contents of the folder include example SQL queries, along with a file showing the results of these queries to demonstrate the validity of the code.

Contents:
MySQL and MS Access SQL Queries: SQL files with queries designed to interact with the hospital database.
SQL Queries Example: SQL_queries_example.sql contains example queries that can be used as a reference.
Queries Results: Queries_Results.txt shows the output of these SQL queries, validating their correctness.

Files in the Folder:
1. SQL_queries_example.sql
This file contains example SQL queries that demonstrate various database interactions, including how to query data, filter results, join tables, and use different SQL functions. These queries are intended to be used as templates and can be customized for specific use cases in the hospital database.

2. Queries_Results.txt
This file contains the results of running the SQL queries from SQL_queries_example.sql. It serves as a demonstration to verify the correctness and validity of the queries provided. You can refer to this file to check if the expected results are returned when running the queries.

3. MySQL_Queries.sql (or another file specific to MySQL)
This file contains MySQL-specific queries for the hospital database. If you're using a MySQL database, this file should be used to execute the queries directly.

4. MS_Access_Queries.sql (or another file specific to MS Access)
This file contains MS Access-specific queries for the hospital database. If you're using MS Access, you can use the queries in this file to interact with the database in the Access environment.
